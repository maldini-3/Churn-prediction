# Churn-prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, the model identifies customers at risk of leaving, allowing businesses to take proactive measures.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented label encoding for categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection:** Selected the most relevant features for improving model accuracy.
- **Upsampling:** Addressed class imbalance in the dataset through upsampling techniques.
- **Model Training:** Employed XGBoost for predictive modeling.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Performance
- Achieved an accuracy of 94% in predicting customer churn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical customer data, including demographics, service usage, and churn labels.
